Project Description
Thera Para is a parody navigation website that uses your camera, TensorFlow.js, and a pinch of chaos to tell you where to go ‚Äî but in the most unhelpful way possible. Directions are random or hilariously based on where you‚Äôre standing in the frame.

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People are finding their destinations too easily. The thrill of getting lost is dying in the GPS era.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We built a web app that proudly ignores actual maps and GPS ‚Äî instead, it uses your camera to give you ‚Äúfun‚Äù directions like LEFT, RIGHT, STRAIGHT, or BACK, whether they make sense or not.

Screenshots

Main UI with camera feed and giant ‚ÄúLEFT‚Äù arrow. Very confident, completely wrong.

Random Mode showing ‚ÄúBACK‚Äù while the user is clearly facing a wall.

Camera Mode detecting a person and giving them an equally useless direction.

For Hardware:

Schematic & Circuit
(Not applicable ‚Äî the only circuit here is in our brains.)

Build Photos

Laptop, coffee mug, webcam ‚Äî the holy trinity.

Coding late into the night, perfecting uselessness.

The glorious final product on screen, arrows pointing in questionable directions.
